## What is effective altruism?<small><sup><a href="#footnote1"> 1</a></sup></small>

<!-- apologies for the inline HTML - this is the only way to get this formatted properly! -->
<p>Effective altruism is about answering one simple question: how can we use our resources to help others the most?</p>

<p>Rather than just doing what feels right, we use evidence and careful analysis to find the very best causes to work on.</p>

<p>Working on a cause is likely to be high impact to the extent that it is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Great in scale</strong> (it affects many peopleâ€™s lives, by a great amount)</li>
  <li><strong>Highly neglected</strong> (few other people are working on addressing the problem), and</li>
  <li><strong>Highly solvable</strong> (additional resources will do a great deal to address it).</li>
</ul>
